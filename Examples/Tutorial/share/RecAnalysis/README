########process of simulaiton, calibration,reconstruction and result analysis#######

Take POINT generation as an example:
  a.$cd /trunk/offline/Examples/Tutorial/share/RecAnalysis/center  

  b.modify parameter "TOPDIR" which means where you save data in 'gdmljob' and 'job' file. 

  c.run the following commamd to get a sample_detsim.root which contains detector geometry information:
      $condor_submit gdml.sh
  
  d.simulation:
    e+ momentum 0, 1.398, 2.436, 3.451, 4.460, 5.465, 6.469, 7.471 MeV,
    corresponding for energy:1.022, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 MeV.
    quantity of each sample: 400 events/job * 50 jobs
      $condor_submit job

  e.calibration:
    change "Executable = sim_run.sh" in 'job' file to "Executable = cal_run.sh" and then
      $condor_submit job

  f.reconstruction:
    change "Executable = cal_run.sh" in 'job' file to "Executable = rec_run.sh" and then
      $condor_submit job

  g.analysis:
    run command
      $root -l RecAnalysis.c  
    you will get *.png and *.eps files of vertex resolution, energy resolution,
    vertex bias, energy uniformity and a txt file "result_center.txt" for each sample
      $root -l draw_plot.C
    will display plots of vertex resolution and energy resolution changes with energy

For uniform generation just change directory to /trunk/offline/Examples/Tutorial/share/RecAnalysis/uniform
and do the same operations.
