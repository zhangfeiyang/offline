the simulation includes: 
	1. USS cables: "pwire0"(2%), "pwire1"(17%), "pwire2"(26%), "pwire3"(55%)
		 USS cables have four layers, as you can see the weight in parenthesis

	2. USS receivers: "pUSSBeCu"
	3. CLS cables: "pCLS1Cable"(38.8%), "pCLS1Cable"(61.2%)
		 there are two cls in left and right with fraction of cls weights, 38.8% and 61.2% respectively.

	4. CLS anchor: "pAnchor"
	5. GTCS tube: "pGT"
	6. GTCS cable: "pCable"
	7. GTCS sensor: "pSensor0", ..., "pSensor9" (ten sensors)

The geometries of GTCS tube and cable are defined in Simulation/DetSimV2/CalibUnit/src/Calib_GuideTube_Construction.cc,
while others are define in Simulation/DetSimV2/CentralDetector/src/DetSim1Construction.cc


The volumes of geometry are already declared in tut_detsim.py, so just use it after compile
 
one example of simulation:
python tut_detsim.py --no-gdml --evtmax 10 gendecay --nuclear K40 --volume pCable

there is no geometry for AURORA, and the contribution of background from AURORA is very small.
if you want simulate it, just put the source at 19.44 m, as a conservative calculation
