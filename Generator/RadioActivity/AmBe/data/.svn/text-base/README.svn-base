The branch.dat provides branch ratio for the AmBe generator.
The branch ratio is for:
ground state neutron,
first excited state neutron.

NOTE1: ignore second excited state(8Be+alpha, ref DYB Chao's docdb-8985)

NOTE2: The branch ratio is obtained from a simple Geant4 simualtion,
can be tuned later on.
