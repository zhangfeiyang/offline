or 
serena.exe 
if using the above default file names

sample_detsim.root: the output of simulation root file which has Tree "/Event/SimEvent" with "JM::SimEvent_branch"
sample_calib.root:  the output of calibration root file which has Tree "/Event/CalibEvent" with "JM::CalibEvent_branch"
sample_rec.root:    the output of simulation root file which has Tree "/Event/RecEvent" with "JM::RecHeader_branch"
sample_detsim_user_op.root: the output of simulation user root file which has Tree "opsteps"
geom.root: the geometry file with "Geometry/JunoGeom", usually the same as sample_detsim.root if generated with option --gdml in simulation
